# showcase

This repo contains the project files from the different hackathons I've participated in. As the original repos are private, I've gathered them all here as a little showcase for what was done.

## Disclaimer
The projects are super simple prototypes and most of the code is ugly. This is because of the ~12 hour timelimit we had at our disposal during the hackathons. Also, as there is no commit-logs from the hackathons here, you won't know spesifically what I contributed with. Feel free to ask.
