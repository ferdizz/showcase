# Hackathon showcase
This repo contains the project files from the different hackathons I've participated in. As the original repos are private, I've gathered them all here as a little showcase for what was done.

## Disclaimer
The projects are super simple prototypes and most of the code is ugly. This is because of the ~20 hour timelimit we had at our disposal during the hackathons (sometimes more, sometimes less). Also, as there is no commit-logs from the hackathons here, you won't know spesifically what I contributed with. Feel free to ask.

## Project descriptions

### Finnder - Microsoft Hackathon Norway 2015
Consisting of four IT-students, our team developed the prototype of an app which combined finn.no with the swiping mechanics from Tinder, and ended up winning the 20-hour long hackathon.

### Tindair - Berg-Hansen Hackathon 2016
Consisting of five IT-students, our team developed the prototype of an app with the goal of making traveling with friends easier to organize. With key elements such as swiping through potential destinations and matching you with friends based on your liked destinations, we believe this can be accomplished.

### Coach - DNB Digital Challenge 2018
During the DNB Digital Challenge in Bergen, my two teammates and I created the concept "Smart Decision" and developed a simple prototype in React. The idea was to help people take the right decision when they're considering buying something. By using DNB's prediction-data (predicted monthly usage - still in development), we can simply simulate how a purchase would affect their future economy. The app should then give simple advices back to the user, telling them how they could afford the purchase by saving/collecting the needed money by using some of DNB's other services (Vipps, Smart Finans, etc).
